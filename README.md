# Blog

There are two reasons for me to become a blogger again

first, take notes. I want to record what I have learned. If I forget something in the future I can review it through reading my blog.

second, share my knowledge. I would like to share my knowledge with others and I hope I can find some like-minded friend to discuss technology together.

## Notes

Everything I show here is based on my understanding, I cannot make sure there is no error in what I wrote here. 

What I can make sure is every code I paste here could be found in my repositories and has been run at least two times by myself.

## Introduction

I will divide my knowledge system into different special columns and the articles in a special column is no order. At present, I will divide my articles into these special columns.

* Java

* Spring 5

* Spring Boot

* Spring MVC

* Hibernate 5

* MyBatis 3

* JavaScript

* ECMAScript 6

* NodeJS

* ReactJS

* AngularJS

* VUE

* Angular

Of course, this is just a preliminary plan. I will add more special columns into my bloger and I will divide a big column into several small columns.

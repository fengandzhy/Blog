# Blog

There are two reasons for me to become a blogger again

first, take notes. I want to record what I have learned. If I forget something in the future I can review it through reading my blog.

second, share my knowledge. I would like to share my knowledge with others and I hope I can find some like-minded friend to discuss technology together.

## Notes

Everything I show here is based on my understanding, I cannot make sure there is no error in what I wrote here. 

What I can make sure is every code I paste here could be found in my repositories and has been run at least two times by myself.

I will divide my articles into different special columns and the articles in a special column are no order.
